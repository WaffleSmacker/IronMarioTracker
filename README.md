# Changelog

## v1.0.2.1 - 2025-02-17

### IronMario Version: v1.0.2

### Bugfixes
- Rewrote the GUI render loop. It's a lot more consistent about the space it uses, window resizing, etc. It also works properly with Windows display scaling, maximized, fullscreen, etc.
- Added ROM version check.

### Performance
- The GUI now only renders once per second instead of every frame. This should drastically reduce framerate drops.

### Interface
- For the music-enabled version, the song title display is now togglable at any time by pressing L+R+A+B.
  - This will probably become the only version, since it can be turned on and off, now.
- Switched fonts for readability at lower resolutions.
- Added the IronMario Challenge icon!
